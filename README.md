# Shazam-Like Song Detection Algorithm

## Project Description
This project involves the development of an algorithm similar to Shazam, designed to detect songs from short audio clips. The algorithm leverages signal processing techniques and machine learning models to identify songs with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Structure
- **Audio Files**: Various audio files used for testing the algorithm.
- **Pickle Files**: Serialized Python objects used by the algorithm.
  - `HASHTABLE.pkl`: A hashtable used in the song detection process.
  - `SONGID.pkl`: A mapping of song identifiers.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Contains the implementation and experiments of the algorithm.
  - `Lab1.ipynb`
  - `Lab2.ipynb`
  - `Lab3.ipynb`
  - `Lab 4.ipynb`
  - `Lab5.ipynb`
  - `Lab6.ipynb`

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: `Python`
- **Libraries**: `NumPy` `SciPy` `matplotlib` `sounddevice` `pydub` `ffmpeg-python` 
- **Tools**: `Jupyter Notebook` 

## Key Achievements
- Developed an algorithm capable of detecting songs from short audio clips with high accuracy
- Implemented signal processing and used Fourier Transform for Implementations
- Deveoped database with the help of HashTable
